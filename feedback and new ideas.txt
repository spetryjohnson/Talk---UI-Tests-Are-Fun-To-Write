Incorporate ideas around timing delays when doing interactive stuff

Make all PageObject properties private, force tests to interact w/ object via methods to force developers to document WHY it matters

Drill into what makes a good assert and page interaction. The existence of a <tr> is a poor way to assert that search results show up, for instance.

Hard to tell the difference between an actual regression, and just a broken test because an element lookup failed. Expressive code / intent revealing code is critical.

Don't select things by looking for text

Don't make assumptions about ordering or sequencing of things, unless that's the point of the test

GoToPage should assert it made it

GoToPage should deal with "page unload" hook
